## Hi!

Hi, I'm Amal, currently a Junior Software Engineer aspiring to improve.

I'm currently learning and solidifying knowledge in Javascript, HTML and CSS while using frameworks such as React. I'm also currently studying to pick up C# with the .Net Framework and possibly some other languages in the future. 

This page will have a few pinned projects to showcase skills and projects I've contributed to. Pinned repos are things that I've worked on and showcase my understanding with what I've done in courses.

## What I'd like to learn or do

- Learn C++ and contribute on a project or create some small app
- Solidify C# and CSS
- Learn something not common, maybe Haskell
- Find if there is an end to learning
