Hi, I'm ggsnipes, I'm currently a student at General Assembly in their Software Engineering Immersive course.

I'm currently learning and solidifying knowledge in Javascript, HTML and CSS while using frameworks such as React. I'm also currently studying to pick up C# with the .Net Framework and possibly some other languages in the future.
